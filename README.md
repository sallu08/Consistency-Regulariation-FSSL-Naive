# Consitency-Regulariation-FSSL-
To overcome data defficiency we make use of unlabeled data. But to ensure that this data is useful we use Consistency Regularization technique in which we create a duplicate set of our exisitng data and some noise is added to make model robust to noise. Original data predictions are used True label for noisy data so that predictions for both dataset are close to each other this technique is called consistency regularization or  consistency training. Then weights of all clients are shared with central server to create a robust and improved Global Model. It is recommended to check the following example to understand implementation of Federated Learning first.
